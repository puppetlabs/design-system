- NOTICE: Packages are now being published to npm instead of Artifactory, so `.npmrc` files with lines ending in `/npm__local/` should replace those instances with `/npm/` (which combines Artifactory with an npm mirror) or remove them if Artifactory is no longer needed. For your per-user `~/.npmrc` file, it's okay to have this line (without `/npm__local/`), but we recommend removing it entirely so that each project can have its own `.npmrc` file to manage dependencies per-project:
  ```
  @puppet:registry=https://artifactory.delivery.puppetlabs.net/artifactory/api/npm/npm/
